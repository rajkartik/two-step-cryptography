1.2 Pattern recognition models

1.2.1 Template Matching

One of the simplest and earliest approaches to pattern recognition is based on template matching. Matching is a generic operation in pattern recognition which is used to determine the similarity between two entities (points, curves, or shapes) of the same type. In template matching, a template (typically, a 2D shape) or a prototype of the pattern to be recognized is available. The pattern to be recognized is matched against the stored template while taking into account all allowable pose (translation and rotation) and scale changes. The similarity measure, often a correlation, may be optimized based on the available training set. Often, the template itself is learned from the training set. Template matching is computationally demanding, but the availability of faster processors has now made this approach more feasible. The rigid template matching mentioned above, while effective in some application domains, has a number of disadvantages. For instance, it would fail if the patterns are distorted due to the imaging process, viewpoint change, or large intraclass variations among the patterns. Deformable template models or rubber sheet deformations can be used to match patterns when the deformation cannot be easily explained or modeled directly.

1.2.2 Statistical Approach

 In the statistical approach, each pattern is represented in terms of d features or measurements and is viewed as a point in a d-dimensional space. The goal is to choose those features that allow pattern vectors belonging to different categories to occupy compact and disjoint regions in a d-dimensional feature space. The effectiveness of the representation space (feature set) is determined by how well patterns from different classes can be separated. Given a set of training patterns from each class, the objective is to establish decision boundaries in the feature space which separate patterns belonging to different classes. In the statistical decision theoretic approach, the decision boundaries are determined by the probability distributions of the patterns belonging to each class, which must either be specified or learned.

1.2.3 Syntactic Approach

 In many recognition problems involving complex patterns, it is more appropriate to adopt a hierarchical perspective where a pattern is viewed as being composed of simple sub-patterns which are themselves built from yet simpler sub-patterns. The simplest/elementary sub-patterns to be recognized are called primitives and the given complex pattern is represented in terms of the interrelationships between these primitives. In syntactic pattern recognition, a formal analogy is drawn between the structure of patterns and the syntax of a language. The patterns are viewed as sentences belonging to a language, primitives are viewed as the alphabet of the language, and the sentences are generated according to a grammar. Thus, a large collection of complex patterns can be described by a small number of primitives and grammatical rules. The grammar for each pattern class must be inferred from the available training samples. Structural pattern recognition is intuitively appealing because, in addition to classification, this approach also provides a description of how the given pattern is constructed from the primitives.

1.2.4 Neural Networks

Neural networks can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of an extremely large number of simple processors with many interconnections. Neural network models attempt to use some organizational principles (such as learning, generalization, adaptivity, fault tolerance and distributed representation, and computation) in a network of weighted directed graphs in which the nodes are artificial neurons and directed edges (with weights) are connections between neuron outputs and neuron inputs. The main characteristics of neural networks are that they have the ability to learn complex nonlinear input-output relationships, use sequential training procedures, and adapt themselves to the data. The most commonly used family of neural networks for pattern classification tasks  is the feed-forward network, which includes multilayer perceptron and Radial-Basis Function (RBF) networks. These networks are organized into layers and have unidirectional connections between the layers.

The pattern to be recognized is matched against the stored template while taking into account all allowable pose (translation and rotation) and scale changes. The similarity measure, often a correlation, may be optimized based on the available training set. Often, the template itself is learned from the training set. Template matching is computationally demanding, but the availability of faster processors has now made this approach more feasible. The rigid template matching mentioned above, while effective in some application domains, has a number of disadvantages. For instance, it would fail if the patterns are distorted due to the imaging process, viewpoint change, or large intraclass variations among the patterns. Deformable template models or rubber sheet deformations can be used to match patterns when the deformation cannot be easily explained or modeled directly.

1.2.2 Statistical Approach

 In the statistical approach, each pattern is represented in terms of d features or measurements and is viewed as a point in a d-dimensional space. The goal is to choose those features that allow pattern vectors belonging to different categories to occupy compact and disjoint regions in a d-dimensional feature space. The effectiveness of the representation space (feature set) is determined by how well patterns from different classes can be separated. Given a set of training patterns from each class, the objective is to establish decision boundaries in the feature space which separate patterns belonging to different classes. In the statistical decision theoretic approach, the decision boundaries are determined by the probability distributions of the patterns belonging to each class, which must either be specified or learned.

1.2.3 Syntactic Approach

 In many recognition problems involving complex patterns, it is more appropriate to adopt a hierarchical perspective where a pattern is viewed as being composed of simple sub-patterns which are themselves built from yet simpler sub-patterns. The simplest/elementary sub-patterns to be recognized are called primitives and the given complex pattern is represented in terms of the interrelationships between these primitives. In syntactic pattern recognition, a formal analogy is drawn between the structure of patterns and the syntax of a language. The patterns are viewed as sentences belonging to a language, primitives are viewed as the alphabet of the language, and the sentences are generated according to a grammar. Thus, a large collection of complex patterns can be described by a small number of primitives and grammatical rules. The grammar for each pattern class must be inferred from the available training samples. Structural pattern recognition is intuitively appealing because, in addition to classification, this approach also provides a description of how the given pattern is constructed from the primitives.

1.2.4 Neural Networks

Neural networks can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of an extremely large number of simple processors with many interconnections. Neural network models attempt to use some organizational principles (such as learning, generalization, adaptivity, fault tolerance and distributed representation, and computation) in a network of weighted directed graphs in which the nodes are artificial neurons and directed edges (with weights) are connections between neuron outputs and neuron inputs. The main characteristics of neural networks are that they have the ability to learn complex nonlinear input-output relationships, use sequential training procedures, and adapt themselves to the data. The most commonly used family of neural networks for pattern classification tasks  is the feed-forward network, which includes multilayer perceptron and Radial-Basis Function (RBF) networks. These networks are organized into layers and have unidirectional connections between the layers.

For instance, it would fail if the patterns are distorted due to the imaging process, viewpoint change, or large intraclass variations among the patterns. Deformable template models or rubber sheet deformations can be used to match patterns when the deformation cannot be easily explained or modeled directly.

1.2.2 Statistical Approach

 In the statistical approach, each pattern is represented in terms of d features or measurements and is viewed as a point in a d-dimensional space. The goal is to choose those features that allow pattern vectors belonging to different categories to occupy compact and disjoint regions in a d-dimensional feature space. The effectiveness of the representation space (feature set) is determined by how well patterns from different classes can be separated. Given a set of training patterns from each class, the objective is to establish decision boundaries in the feature space which separate patterns belonging to different classes. In the statistical decision theoretic approach, the decision boundaries are determined by the probability distributions of the patterns belonging to each class, which must either be specified or learned.

1.2.3 Syntactic Approach

 In many recognition problems involving complex patterns, it is more appropriate to adopt a hierarchical perspective where a pattern is viewed as being composed of simple sub-patterns which are themselves built from yet simpler sub-patterns. The simplest/elementary sub-patterns to be recognized are called primitives and the given complex pattern is represented in terms of the interrelationships between these primitives. In syntactic pattern recognition, a formal analogy is drawn between the structure of patterns and the syntax of a language. The patterns are viewed as sentences belonging to a language, primitives are viewed as the alphabet of the language, and the sentences are generated according to a grammar. Thus, a large collection of complex patterns can be described by a small number of primitives and grammatical rules. The grammar for each pattern class must be inferred from the available training samples. Structural pattern recognition is intuitively appealing because, in addition to classification, this approach also provides a description of how the given pattern is constructed from the primitives.

1.2.4 Neural Networks

Neural networks can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of an extremely large number of simple processors with many interconnections. Neural network models attempt to use some organizational principles (such as learning, generalization, adaptivity, fault tolerance and distributed representation, and computation) in a network of weighted directed graphs in which the nodes are artificial neurons and directed edges (with weights) are connections between neuron outputs and neuron inputs. The main characteristics of neural networks are that they have the ability to learn complex nonlinear input-output relationships, use sequential training procedures, and adapt themselves to the data. The most commonly used family of neural networks for pattern classification tasks  is the feed-forward network, which includes multilayer perceptron and Radial-Basis Function (RBF) networks. These networks are organized into layers and have unidirectional connections between the layers.

1.2.1 Template Matching

One of the simplest and earliest approaches to pattern recognition is based on template matching. Matching is a generic operation in pattern recognition which is used to determine the similarity between two entities (points, curves, or shapes) of the same type. In template matching, a template (typically, a 2D shape) or a prototype of the pattern to be recognized is available. The pattern to be recognized is matched against the stored template while taking into account all allowable pose (translation and rotation) and scale changes. The similarity measure, often a correlation, may be optimized based on the available training set. Often, the template itself is learned from the training set. Template matching is computationally demanding, but the availability of faster processors has now made this approach more feasible.

The effectiveness of the representation space (feature set) is determined by how well patterns from different classes can be separated. Given a set of training patterns from each class, the objective is to establish decision boundaries in the feature space which separate patterns belonging to different classes. In the statistical decision theoretic approach, the decision boundaries are determined by the probability distributions of the patterns belonging to each class, which must either be specified or learned.

1.2.3 Syntactic Approach

 In many recognition problems involving complex patterns, it is more appropriate to adopt a hierarchical perspective where a pattern is viewed as being composed of simple sub-patterns which are themselves built from yet simpler sub-patterns. The simplest/elementary sub-patterns to be recognized are called primitives and the given complex pattern is represented in terms of the interrelationships between these primitives. In syntactic pattern recognition, a formal analogy is drawn between the structure of patterns and the syntax of a language. The patterns are viewed as sentences belonging to a language, primitives are viewed as the alphabet of the language, and the sentences are generated according to a grammar. Thus, a large collection of complex patterns can be described by a small number of primitives and grammatical rules. The grammar for each pattern class must be inferred from the available training samples. Structural pattern recognition is intuitively appealing because, in addition to classification, this approach also provides a description of how the given pattern is constructed from the primitives.

1.2.4 Neural Networks

Neural networks can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of an extremely large number of simple processors with many interconnections. Neural network models attempt to use some organizational principles (such as learning, generalization, adaptivity, fault tolerance and distributed representation, and computation) in a network of weighted directed graphs in which the nodes are artificial neurons and directed edges (with weights) are connections between neuron outputs and neuron inputs. The main characteristics of neural networks are that they have the ability to learn complex nonlinear input-output relationships, use sequential training procedures, and adapt themselves to the data. The most commonly used family of neural networks for pattern classification tasks  is the feed-forward network, which includes multilayer perceptron and Radial-Basis Function (RBF) networks. These networks are organized into layers and have unidirectional connections between the layers.

Picard has identified a novel application of pattern recognition, called affective computing which will give a computer the ability to recognize and express emotions, to respond intelligently to human emotion, and to employ mechanisms of emotion that contribute to rational decision making.

1.2.1 Template Matching

One of the simplest and earliest approaches to pattern recognition is based on template matching. Matching is a generic operation in pattern recognition which is used to determine the similarity between two entities (points, curves, or shapes) of the same type. In template matching, a template (typically, a 2D shape) or a prototype of the pattern to be recognized is available. The pattern to be recognized is matched against the stored template while taking into account all allowable pose (translation and rotation) and scale changes. The similarity measure, often a correlation, may be optimized based on the available training set. Often, the template itself is learned from the training set. Template matching is computationally demanding, but the availability of faster processors has now made this approach more feasible. The rigid template matching mentioned above, while effective in some application domains, has a number of disadvantages. For instance, it would fail if the patterns are distorted due to the imaging process, viewpoint change, or large intraclass variations among the patterns. Deformable template models or rubber sheet deformations can be used to match patterns when the deformation cannot be easily explained or modeled directly.
